* Installation

The project is thought to be easily installable
with no dependencies so that people in any environment
can get it. The easiest way to install it is
through this shell script

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for folder in ftdetect syntax; do
  mkdir -p ~/.vim/$folder
  url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alejandrogallo/org-syntax.vim/main/$folder/org.vim"
  wget $url -O ~/.vim/$folder/org.vim
done
#+END_SRC

or if you are using a package manager for vim then simply
you would write something like in your =~/.vimrc=

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
Plug 'alejandrogallo/org-syntax.vim'
#+END_SRC
